## Description

The goal of this web application was to use the skills we learned with WEB APIs to create a timed JavaScript Test. The user will have 60 seconds to complete the test. The test has a total of 5 questions with mutliple choice answers. Everytime the use chooses the incorrect answer, the will lose 5 seconds from the countdown. Once completed, the user can enter their initials, hit the submit and view their scores. The faster they are the better higher the score.

The technical skills needed was to show the use of arrays, eventlisteners, array objects, call back functions,time inntervals, for loop functions, condtional statements, DOM manipulation, consol.log to see bugs in our code via the consol in the google inspect, etc.
